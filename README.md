# Email-Alerts-on-Whatsapp

Emails have become one of the most used digital communication mediums. But, sad truth that since that they are so aggressively used,it's quite difficult to keep up with them.
My project aims to send email alerts on whatsapp using #puppeteer and Twilio Whatsapp Sandbox.
You just need to enter the sender's name and date and it will send you an array of email details like subject,from and date to your whatsapp inbox.
